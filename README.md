# cactus

A Go ACME server that issues **Merkle Tree certificates** per
[draft-ietf-plants-merkle-tree-certs-04][draft], intended for
**testing environments only**.

> ⚠ This is *not* a production CA. There is no fsync ladder, no
> shared-state coordination, and the single-writer assumption is
> enforced by documentation rather than by locks. See
> [docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md) before running it
> anywhere it could be reached.

For a tutorial introduction to *how Merkle Tree certificates work*
(why a cert has no real signature, what the inclusion proof is
proving, how landmarks and mirrors fit), read [MTC.md](MTC.md). The
rest of this README is about cactus itself: what it does, how to
operate it, and where to look in the code.

## What it does

- Runs an **ACME server** (RFC 8555) extended with the §9
  cert-download negotiation from the draft, including
  `application/pem-certificate-chain-with-properties` with a real
  `CertificatePropertyList`.
- Maintains a CA-operated **issuance log** with on-disk tiles, signed
  checkpoints (c2sp signed-note format), and signed §4.5 covering
  subtrees.
- Issues **standalone X.509 certificates** (§6.2) whose
  `signatureAlgorithm` is `id-alg-mtcProof` and whose `signatureValue`
  body is an `MTCProof` blob carrying an inclusion proof + cosigner
  signatures.
- Supports **landmark-relative certificates** (§6.3). Allocates
  landmarks per §6.3.2 and serves a `/landmarks` endpoint per §6.3.1.
  The signature-free landmark-relative form is derived from the log
  out-of-band with `cactus-cli cert landmark-relative` (not over the
  ACME API).
- Acts as a **CA cosigner** using ML-DSA-44 (requires a Go 1.27+ build).
- Optionally **runs as a cosigning mirror** for an external upstream
  log ([tlog-mirror], [tlog-cosignature]). In mirror mode cactus
  follows an upstream via tlog-tiles, verifies consistency, and
  exposes a `/sign-subtree` endpoint that signs §5.4.1 inputs with
  its own cosigner key.
- In CA mode, **collects cosignatures from a configured set of
  external mirrors** in parallel, with quorum + per-mirror timeout +
  best-effort-after-minimum semantics.

## What it does not do

- **Witness-only cosigners** (§7.3). Mirror cosigners are in scope;
  pure witnesses are out of scope.
- **Log pruning** (§5.2.3).
- **Real DNS-01 challenges.** `auto-pass` and `http-01` are
  supported; DNS-01 is not.
- **Revoked ranges** (§7.5) beyond a stub list in config.

## Quickstart

```sh
# 0. Clone & build.
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/cactus
cd cactus
make build              # produces ./bin/cactus, cactus-cli, cactus-keygen

# 1. Pick a data directory.
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/cactus
mkdir -p "$DATA_DIR/keys"

# 2. Write a config.json — start from config-example.json. The
#    example writes to /tmp/cactus-data; substitute your DATA_DIR.
cp config-example.json config.json
sed -i "s|/tmp/cactus-data|$DATA_DIR|" config.json

# 3. Run the server. On first start it generates the CA cosigner
#    seed at $DATA_DIR/keys/ca-cosigner.seed (mode 0600). To inspect
#    or pre-generate one yourself, use ./bin/cactus-keygen -o <path>.
./bin/cactus -config config.json
```

You'll see structured JSON logs on stdout. The default
config-example listens on:

- `:14000` — ACME (HTTP, plaintext for tests)
- `:14080` — monitoring read-path. The monitoring base URL is the **CA
  prefix**; each issuance log is served as a tiled transparency log under
  `/<log number>/` (`/<log number>/checkpoint`, `/<log number>/tile/…`,
  `/<log number>/landmarks`), per the MTC-with-tlog profile. The
  CA-level `/ca-certificate` lives at the root.
- `127.0.0.1:14090` — Prometheus metrics + pprof

Once it's up (log number `1` in the example config):

```sh
curl http://localhost:14000/directory     # ACME directory
curl http://localhost:14080/1/checkpoint   # current signed-note checkpoint
curl http://localhost:14090/metrics        # Prometheus metrics
```

Stop it with `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) or `kill -TERM` — graceful shutdown
drains the pool, writes a final checkpoint, and closes listeners.

---

## Operating modes

The same binary can run in any combination of three concerns,
determined by which top-level config blocks are populated and
`enabled`:

| Concern | Adds | Set |
|---|---|---|
| **CA** (default) | Issuance log + ACME server + landmark-relative certs | `acme`, `log`, `ca_cosigner` |
| **CA-side mirror collection** | Multi-mirror cosignatures during issuance | `ca_cosigner_quorum.mirrors[]` |
| **Mirror operating mode** | Follow an upstream + serve `/sign-subtree` | `mirror.enabled = true` (and `mirror.upstream`) |

Landmark-relative cert support is always on; only its cadence is
tunable (see `landmarks` below).

Cactus operating modes are not enumerated; the binary just brings up
whichever subsystems the config asks for. The validator does enforce
some hygiene rules — chiefly, mirror + CA modes in the same binary
must use distinct cosigner keys.

---

## Issuing your first cert

Use any RFC 8555 ACME client. With `lego`:

```sh
lego --server http://localhost:14000/directory \
     --email you@example.com \
     --domains example.test \
     --accept-tos \
     --pem \
     --path ./certs run
```

Or hand-rolled with `cactus-cli` for inspection (run *after*
issuing at least one cert; entries are §5.2.1 MerkleTreeCertEntry
blobs):

```sh
# After issuance, find the cert's index in the log:
curl http://localhost:14080/1/checkpoint
# (parse the second body line — that's the tree size)

# Show the most recent entry, where N = (tree size - 1).
# The log base URL is the monitoring base + "/<log number>":
./bin/cactus-cli entry http://localhost:14080/1 N

# Verify the issued cert end-to-end:
./bin/cactus-cli cert verify ./certs/example.test.crt http://localhost:14080/1
```

The cert verify path runs the full §7.2 procedure: split the
certificate, decode the MTCProof, recompute the leaf hash from the
TBS (substituting the public key with its hash), evaluate the
inclusion proof, and compare against the live log's subtree hash.
On match it prints `OK`.

---

## Verifying certs with the CLI

```
cactus-cli tree show   <log-url>            # checkpoint origin/size/root
cactus-cli tree verify <log-url>            # walk tiles, recompute root, compare
cactus-cli entry       <log-url> <index>    # fetch + decode one entry
cactus-cli cert verify <cert.pem> <log-url> # full §7.2 verification
cactus-cli prove       <log-url> <index>    # JSON inclusion proof for scripting
```

`tree verify` is the gut check that the on-disk tile bytes really
add up to the signed root: it walks every data tile, replays each
entry through `tlog.StoredHashes`, and compares the computed
`TreeHash` to the signed-note checkpoint. Used by monitors that want
to be sure the log isn't lying about what it has.

`prove` emits a JSON object that's easy to pipe to `jq`:

```sh
./bin/cactus-cli prove http://localhost:14080 1 | jq .
{
  "index": 1,
  "tree_size": 2,
  "root_hex": "...",
  "leaf_hash_hex": "...",
  "inclusion_proof_hex": ["..."]
}
```

## Configuration reference

A complete config is in [config-example.json](config-example.json).
The blocks below are the load-bearing ones.

### `log`

```json
"log": {
  "number": 1,
  "shortname": "cactus-test",
  "hash": "sha256",
  "checkpoint_period_ms": 1000,
  "pool_size": 256
}
```

`number` is the issuance log's log number (1–65535, §5.2); the log ID
is derived as `<ca_cosigner.id>.0.<number>` and the issuer DN is the
CA ID. `checkpoint_period_ms` is how often the sequencer flushes pooled
entries and signs a new checkpoint; lower = lower issuance latency, more
signatures per second.

### `ca_cosigner`

```json
"ca_cosigner": {
  "id": "1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.1.99",
  "algorithm": "mldsa-44",
  "seed_path": "keys/ca-cosigner.seed"
}
```

`id` is the **CA ID** (§5.1): draft-04 §5.4 requires the CA cosigner's
ID to equal the CA ID, so this one value identifies the CA, seeds the
issuer DN, and roots all derived log / landmark IDs.

`algorithm` **must be `mldsa-44`** (the validator rejects anything else).
The MTC-with-tlog profile requires every MTC cosigner — including the CA
cosigner that signs checkpoints — to use an ML-DSA-44 key and produce
ML-DSA-44 [tlog-cosignature] signed messages, since that is currently the
only algorithm available in both X.509 and C2SP in a subtree-capable
form. ML-DSA-44 is the only cosigner algorithm cactus implements (with
`mldsa-65`/`mldsa-87` available for experiments). It uses Go's built-in
`crypto/mldsa`, so **cactus requires a Go 1.27+ build** (until 1.27
ships, a `gotip` 1.27-devel toolchain works); there are no build tags,
and an older toolchain simply won't compile cactus.

### `acme`

```json
"acme": {
  "listen": ":14000",
  "external_url": "http://localhost:14000",
  "challenge_mode": "auto-pass"
}
```

`challenge_mode` is `auto-pass` (every authorization is instantly
valid; for tests) or `http-01` (real fetch of
`http://identifier/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>`).

### `landmarks` (tuning only)

```json
"landmarks": {
  "time_between_landmarks_ms": 3600000,
  "max_cert_lifetime_ms": 604800000
}
```

Landmarks are always on; this block only tunes the cadence and the
max cert lifetime (both optional, with the defaults shown). The
§6.3.1 list is always served at `/landmarks`. Landmark trust anchor
IDs are derived from the CA ID and log number (`CA-ID.1.logNumber.L`,
§6.3.1) — there's no separate `base_id`. Defaults: 1-hour landmark
cadence, 7-day max cert lifetime ⇒ `max_active_landmarks =
ceil(168) + 1 = 169` ⇒ ~10 KiB of relying party state per CA. See
§6.3.1 of the draft.

### `mirror` (optional, mirror mode)

```json
"mirror": {
  "enabled": true,
  "cosigner_id": "1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.2.1.mirror",
  "seed_path": "keys/mirror-cosigner.seed",
  "algorithm": "mldsa-44",
  "upstream": {
    "tile_url": "https://upstream.example/log",
    "log_id": "1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.1.99.0.1",
    "ca_cosigner_id": "1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.1.99",
    "ca_cosigner_key_path": "keys/ca-cosigner.pub.pem",
    "ca_cosigner_algorithm": "mldsa-44",
    "poll_interval_ms": 1000
  },
  "sign_subtree_listen": ":14081",
  "sign_subtree_path": "/sign-subtree",
  "require_ca_signature_on_subtree": true,
  "checkpoint_cosignatures": true
}
```

The mirror's cosigner ID + seed must differ from the CA's (the
validator rejects shared keys). The cosigner `algorithm` **must be
`mldsa-44`**: the [tlog-witness] `sign-subtree` response is an ML-DSA-44
[tlog-cosignature] (there is no ECDSA cosignature type), so the witness
path requires it and a mirror cosigner therefore needs a Go 1.27+ build.
`require_ca_signature_on_subtree` is the [tlog-witness] DoS gate — keep
it on if the `/sign-subtree` listener is publicly reachable; the CA's
subtree cosignature it requires must likewise be ML-DSA-44.

### `ca_cosigner_quorum` (optional, CA-side mirror requests)

```json
"ca_cosigner_quorum": {
  "mirrors": [
    {
      "id": "example.mirror.1",
      "url": "https://mirror-1.example/sign-subtree",
      "algorithm": "mldsa-44",
      "public_key_path": "keys/mirror-1.pub.pem"
    }
  ],
  "min_signatures": 1,
  "request_timeout_ms": 2000,
  "best_effort_after_minimum": true,
  "mirror_retry_deadline_ms": 5000
}
```

When set, every flush fires a parallel sign-subtree request to all
listed mirrors; the issuance waits for at least `min_signatures`
mirror sigs to arrive before `Wait` returns. The retry deadline lets
the requester poll-and-retry while mirrors catch up to the new
checkpoint (mirrors can't sign a subtree until they've verified the
checkpoint that contains it).

---

## Observability

cactus emits structured JSON logs (slog) on stdout. Every line carries
`time`, `level`, `msg`, plus event-specific fields like `request_id`.

Prometheus metrics on `127.0.0.1:14090/metrics`:

| Metric | Labels | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `cactus_acme_orders_total` | `status` | Counter |
| `cactus_log_entries_total` | | Counter |
| `cactus_log_checkpoints_total` | | Counter |
| `cactus_pool_flush_size` | | Histogram |
| `cactus_signature_duration_seconds` | `alg` | Histogram |
| `cactus_mirror_upstream_checkpoint_size` | | Gauge |
| `cactus_mirror_consistency_failures_total` | | Counter |
| `cactus_mirror_signsubtree_requests_total` | `result` | Counter |
| `cactus_mirror_signsubtree_duration_seconds` | | Histogram |
| `cactus_ca_mirror_request_total` | `mirror_id`, `result` | Counter |
| `cactus_ca_quorum_failures_total` | | Counter |

Plus stdlib Go runtime metrics (goroutines, GC, etc.) and pprof
under `/debug/pprof` on the same listener.

to "verifiable bytes on disk".

---

## Tests

cactus requires **Go 1.27+** (built-in `crypto/mldsa`). Until 1.27 ships,
use a `gotip` 1.27-devel toolchain; an older `go` won't compile cactus.

```sh
gotip test -race -count=1 ./...
gotip test -fuzz=FuzzParseMTCProof -fuzztime=30s ./cert/...
gotip test -fuzz=FuzzParseSignSubtreeRequest -fuzztime=30s ./mirror/...
make integration                                       # `gotip test -race -count=1 -tags=integration ./integration/...`
```

The cornerstone tests:

- `integration.TestParallelIssuance` — 100 certs issued in parallel,
  each independently re-verified end-to-end via §7.2.
- `integration.TestRestartContinuesIssuance` — 50 + restart + 50,
  with the pre-restart certs still verifying against the now-larger
  tree.
- `integration.TestRelyingPartyFastPath` — landmark-relative cert
  verification *without* consulting any cosigner key, using only
  the public `/landmarks` + tile-served subtree hashes.
- `integration.TestEndToEndCAWithThreeMirrors` — a CA, three
  mirror followers + servers, `quorum=2`. Issued cert lands with
  1 CA + 2 mirror sigs, each independently verifiable.
- `integration.TestMirrorRestartResume` — mirror restart picks up
  where it left off without re-fetching everything.
- `integration.TestCactusBinaryStartsAndServes` and
  `integration.TestCactusBinaryMirrorMode` — actually run the
  binary, drive it over HTTP.
